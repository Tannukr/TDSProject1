1. Data Collection: We used the GitHub API to retrieve user profiles and repository data for developers in Mumbai with a minimum follower count of 50, implementing requests to handle pagination and response parsing.

2. Interesting Finding: Developers with more than 50 followers and detailed repositories exhibit higher engagement, with a correlation between follower count and the number of repository watchers.

3. Developer Recommendation: Developers can enhance visibility and engagement by focusing on clear documentation, adding README files to repositories, and regularly updating project information to attract collaborators and watchers.
